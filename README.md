# ksp-kOS-scripts

This is a collection of scripts I wrote to launch a rocket into Low Kerbin Orbit in Kerbal Space Program. They are still incomplete, and are currently abandoned. Things like data readouts may not work as intended and the launch profile is likely far from optimal. Unfortunately I lost the .craft file at some point. Sorry about that. To make the scripts work, you'll need a copy of Kerbal Space Program (duh) and the kOS mod: https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/

Fly safe, and have fun!

CONTENTS
========
* gravityturn.ks -- ***you most likely want this one.*** it's the most complete script, and puts a simple 2-stage rocket into LKO
* gravturn2.ks   -- refactored version of gravityturn.ks that was started but never finished
* hello.ks       -- does a countdown and then says hello
* hellolaunch.ks -- if i remember correctly this one just tries to get the apoapsis up to 100km
