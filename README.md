# ksp-kOS-scripts

This is a collection of scripts I wrote to launch a rocket into Low Kerbin Orbit in Kerbal Space Program. They are still incomplete, ~~and are currently abandoned.~~ Things like data readouts may not work as intended and the launch profile is likely far from optimal. Unfortunately I lost the .craft file at some point. Sorry about that. To make the scripts work, you'll need a copy of Kerbal Space Program (duh) and the kOS mod: https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/

Fly safe, and have fun!

UPDATE 8/30/2022:

The bug bit me again, and this project is getting unmothballed. Expect craft files and scripts. The first project is going to be a small communications satellite with scripts and a launch schedule to set up the cutest little equatorial relay system for use with RemoteTech.
